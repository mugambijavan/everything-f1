# everything-f1
Everything-F1 is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model and a vector database to provide context-aware answers to questions about Formula 1 racing. This project demonstrates how to build a RAG application using TypeScript, OpenAI, DataStax Astra DB, and Playwright.
